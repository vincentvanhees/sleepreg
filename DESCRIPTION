Description: A tool to calculate the Sleep Regularity Index (SRI; Phillips et. 
    al., 2017), a summary of day-to-day overlap in sleep patterns for an 
    individual. The SRI can be calculated from raw accelerometer data in .csv
    format, or binary sleep data (e.g., sleep diaries). Accelerometer analysis 
    makes use of the GGIR package (van Hees et. al., 2015; Migueles et. al., 2019; 
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/GGIR.pdf>) to predict daily 
    sleep-wake timing and periods of sustained inactivity. GGIR outputs are used
    to estimate fragmented sleep schedules, for accurate calculation 
    of SRI.
